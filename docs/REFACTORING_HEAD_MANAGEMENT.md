# HEAD Management Refactoring

## Summary

Extracted duplicate HEAD resolution and update logic from multiple command classes into centralized `Repository` helper methods to improve code maintainability and consistency.

## Problem

Multiple command classes (`LogCommand`, `ResetCommand`, `CommitCommand`, `StatusCommand`) were implementing nearly identical logic for:
1. Reading and parsing `.gitter/HEAD`
2. Resolving branch references to commit hashes
3. Writing commit hashes back to branch references

This duplication:
- Violated the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Increased maintenance burden (bugs need to be fixed in multiple places)
- Introduced inconsistency in error handling
- Made the code harder to understand

## Solution

Added two static helper methods to the `Repository` class:

### 1. `resolveHEAD(const std::filesystem::path& root)`

**Purpose:** Resolve HEAD to the current commit hash

**Returns:** `Expected<std::pair<std::string, std::string>>` where:
- First string: commit hash (empty if no commits yet)
- Second string: branch reference path (e.g., "refs/heads/main")

**Behavior:**
- Reads `.gitter/HEAD` file
- If HEAD points to a branch (`ref: refs/heads/main`), reads the branch reference file
- Returns empty hash if branch reference file doesn't exist (no commits yet)
- Handles detached HEAD (direct commit hash) correctly
- Provides consistent error messages

### 2. `updateHEAD(const std::filesystem::path& root, const std::string& commitHash)`

**Purpose:** Update HEAD to point to a commit hash

**Returns:** `Expected<void>` (success or error)

**Behavior:**
- Reads `.gitter/HEAD` to determine whether we're on a branch
- Writes commit hash to the appropriate branch reference file
- Creates parent directories if needed
- Handles detached HEAD updates
- Validates write success with flush and error checking

## Affected Files

### Added Methods
- `src/core/Repository.hpp` - Method declarations
- `src/core/Repository.cpp` - Method implementations (~90 lines added)

### Refactored Commands
- `src/cli/commands/LogCommand.cpp` - Reduced from ~50 lines to ~15 lines
- `src/cli/commands/ResetCommand.cpp` - Reduced from ~45 lines to ~15 lines
- `src/cli/commands/CommitCommand.cpp` - Reduced from ~35 lines to ~10 lines
- `src/cli/commands/StatusCommand.cpp` - Reduced from ~30 lines to ~10 lines

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Code Duplication:** Eliminated ~150+ lines of duplicated logic
2. **Consistent Behavior:** All commands now handle HEAD resolution identically
3. **Better Error Handling:** Centralized error messages are more descriptive
4. **Easier Maintenance:** Bug fixes and improvements only need to be made once
5. **Improved Testability:** Helper methods can be unit tested independently

## Backward Compatibility

âœ… **Fully compatible** - All existing functionality preserved, no behavior changes

## Testing

All existing tests should pass without modification since the refactoring preserves the exact same behavior, just with code moved to a shared location.

## Future Enhancements

The centralized HEAD management methods make it easier to:
- Add support for symbolic references
- Implement branch operations (create, delete, rename)
- Handle HEAD reflog tracking
- Support multiple HEAD states (ORIG_HEAD, MERGE_HEAD, etc.)

## Example Usage

### Before (Duplicated in Each Command)
```cpp
std::filesystem::path headPath = root / ".gitter" / "HEAD";
if (!std::filesystem::exists(headPath)) {
    return Error{ErrorCode::InvalidArgs, "no commits yet"};
}
std::ifstream headFile(headPath);
// ... 40+ lines of logic ...
```

### After (Single Helper Call)
```cpp
auto headRes = Repository::resolveHEAD(root);
if (!headRes) {
    return Error{headRes.error().code, headRes.error().message};
}
auto [currentHash, branchRef] = headRes.value();
if (currentHash.empty()) {
    return Error{ErrorCode::InvalidArgs, "no commits yet"};
}
```

## Related Patterns

This refactoring demonstrates:
- **Single Responsibility Principle:** `Repository` now owns all HEAD management
- **DRY Principle:** Eliminated code duplication across commands
- **Facade Pattern:** `Repository` provides a simplified interface to HEAD operations
- **Static Helper Methods:** Shared functionality without requiring instance state
